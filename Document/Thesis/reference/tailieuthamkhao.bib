  abstract={In this paper, we present a finite-granularity, loading algorithm for a discrete multitone (DMT) modulation system. The proposed algorithm offers significant implementational advantages over the well-known water-pouring method and the earlier Hughes-Hartogs algorithm, while typically suffering only negligible performance degradation relative to the optimal solution. We also present simulation results of this loading algorithm applied to the newly proposed asymmetric digital subscriber lines (ADSL) service.<>},
